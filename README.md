- ðŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m @oldfart95
- ðŸ‘€ Iâ€™m interested in Art, Game Dev, and Creative AI. 
- ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning gouache and watercolor mediums, though my craftiness with Infinite Painter is scary to myself. 
- ðŸ“« How to reach me ... ... I'm working on that.


It seems if you're "from" Intel, or a criminal, you'll reach me regardless.
Just like y'all did before. 

Now, go catch my mail thief. 

(Art? for realzies? yep. Sat down and worked my first official drawing as a digital painting of "The Cross, Triumphant" {I literally just now found that name in my mind, tis fitting}. You'll see it soon. Scared the daylights out of myself when I was done.) 


Now, ladies, gentlemen, humans and otherwise, goodnight. For those "otherwise", Goodbye.
